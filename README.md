# Cubic NK-SVD: An Algorithm for Designing Parametric Dictionary for Frequency Estimation

## Introduction

- This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of cubic NK-SVD algorithm designed for line spectral estimation (LSE) problem. The code is associated with the following paper :

  - Title - Cubic NK-SVD: An Algorithm for Designing Parametric Dictionary for Frequency Estimation
  - Authors - Xiaozhi Liu, Yong Xia
  - Arxiv link - https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03708

- If you use this simulation code package in any way, please cite the original paper above.
- The author in charge of this simulation code pacakge is: Xiaozhi Liu (email: xzliu@buaa.edu.cn).

## Usage
The algorithm is implemented in the following two main files:
- `main.m` - It provides an example application of the method and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in LSE problem. Running this file will generate plots and output relevant results, showing the performance of the algorithm.
- `cubic_nk_svd.m` - It is the core implementation of the proposed algorithm. It takes the input data and computes the estimated frequencies and corresponding gains.
